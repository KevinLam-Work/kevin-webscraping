## Active project ongoing: Labour Cost of Trading Economics
*Scenario: You haven't got a license in Trading Economics, but you want to automate the extraction of historical data*

*What I have attempted, is this...*

(1) Select the option for showing 10 years range and in line chart format

(2) This gives an SVG path when located the element

(3) With the help of Last and Previous data points...

(4) Calculate the offset and coefficient (slope) and reverse engineer the original data points

(5) Save as a dataframe for further procedures

However...

At this stage, I am stuck with the selenium partðŸ¥², it somehow couldn't extract the path element with XPATH 
"//*[@id="highcharts-inhwuj5-0"]/svg/g[7]/g[1]/path[1]"

Research ongoing...
